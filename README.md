# Email Correspondences

## Problem Description
The goal of this project was to summarize email activity of individuals in a series of email conversations. This entailed careful cleaning, sorting, and aggregating of email conversations in an email archive contained in csv file. Each record (row) represented a conversation. For each of these conversations, information was included about the subjects, recipients, and level of importance.

## Objectives
The objectives were met through answering the following questions:
 + What is the total number of conversations in which each individual participated?
 + how many times that person appeared in the “From”, “To”, “CC”, and “BCC” columns, respectively?
 + whether that person ever appeared in a conversation that was marked as highly important.
