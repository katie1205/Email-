# Email Correspondences

## Context:
Academic - I completed this project as an assignment for an MSDA computer science course.

## Problem:
The goal of this project was to summarize email activity of individuals in a series of email conversations. This entailed cleaning and summarizing a filtered email archive containing the subjects, recipients, and importance of email conversations. 

you need to find out how many conversations that person was involved in, how many
times that person appeared in the “From”, “To”, “CC”, and “BCC” columns,
respectively. And whether that person ever appeared in a conversation that was
marked as highly important.
